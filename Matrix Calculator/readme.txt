Python program designed to determine characteristics and do simple operations on matricies. It can be run with either an interactive option where a command line argument is not given, or a pre written option where a command line argument is given like the test file provided.

How to compile and run

To use the interactive mode of the matshell run the command: python3 CS320Program2.py 
in your terminal. For operations, enter them with spaces ex. A + B or ~ A not A+B/~A.
 
To use the second mode, run the command: python3 CS320Program2.py test.txt 
in your terminal or create your own .msh/.txt file. For operations, enter them with spaces ex. A + B or ~ A not A+B/~A.
